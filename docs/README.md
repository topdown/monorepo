# Docs

This `docs/` folder is included as a place to keep repository-level documentation that belongs in the monorepo (architecture notes, public docs for packages, contributor guides, etc.).

Suggested layout:

- `docs/README.md` (this file)
- `docs/architecture.md` — high-level system overview
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines

Keep docs in Markdown and reference them from the root `README.md` where helpful.
