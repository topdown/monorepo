# Architecture

Describe the high-level architecture of your monorepo here. Example sections:

- Overview: packages vs apps vs tools.
- Data flow: how `frontend`/`website` talk to `api`/`backend`.
- Shared libraries: `packages/utils` and intended responsibilities.
- Deployment: suggested CI/CD flows for each app.

Replace this content with your project's architecture notes.
